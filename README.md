# MoneyMan

A browser-based coin collection game. Run around with your money bag and catch falling coins before they hit the ground!

## How to Play

- **Move left**: Arrow Left or `A`
- **Move right**: Arrow Right or `D`
- Catch falling coins to earn points (+10 each)
- Don't let coins hit the ground — you lose a life for each miss
- 3 lives total — game over when they're all gone
- Difficulty increases over time: coins fall faster and spawn more frequently
